# Installation (for contributors)

1. Open the Ren 'Py launcher

2. Navigate to Preferences

3. Set the Projects directory to anywhere you like

4. Clone the repository to that directory (if using Windows, use the Github webapp; otherwise, command line is OK)

5. Extract the gui and image folders inside the game folder (as folders, not just the contents of each folder)

6. At this point, you should be able to access and run SPEVN from the Projects section of the launcher
